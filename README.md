# COMP6231_Project

## introduction

This project is a software failure tolerant/highly available distributed player status system. There are three locations in this system: North-America (NA), Europe (EU) and Asia (AS). Each location has a server, which can perform some operations and maintain several player accounts. Player accounts contain the information of players in this location. Also, the server contains some logs about the history of all operations that have been performed on this server.
